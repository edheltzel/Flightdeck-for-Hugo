## What it is

Flightdeck for Hugo is an opinionated starter project for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) that takes advantage of Hugo's built in [asset pipeline](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/).

Includes:

- Base templates using HTML with partials creating components.
- Hugo Pipes ready to compile, minify, and MD5-hash for Scss/CSS and JavaScript with environment variables.
- Hugo Pipes for PostCSS using Autoprefixer and PurgeCSS
- Simple Google Analytics integration.
- Imagemin for image optimization
  - Please note that Hugo's built in [image processing](https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/) does not work on images located inside of `/static`. This is why we chose to use Gulp and Imagemin.
- Deployment with rsync and [Flightdeck Liftoff](https://github.com/flight-deck/flightdeck-liftoff).

## What it is NOT

Flightdeck for Hugo **IS NOT** a Hugo theme. It **CANNOT** be dropped inside the `/themes` directory.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that Hugo is installed by checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo) on the Hugo docs... make sure you're running the extended version.

## Usage

First things first, clone this repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:flight-deck/Flightdeck-for-Hugo.git MY-HUGO-PROJECT && cd MY-HUGO-PROJECT
```

Then run the Node commands

```shell
yarn
yarn start
```

**OR**

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

### Adding Pages

To add main site pages run the `hugo new` command and create a markdown file in the `pages/` directory. Then create a corresponding `html` template file in `layouts/pages/`

Example:

```
hugo new pages/my-new-page.md
```

The `header.html` partial is configured to generate a main site navigation by utilizing [Hugo Menu Templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/menu-templates). The `pages.md` archetype sets each page markdown file to the main menu via front matter.

### Available Scripts

There are 4 available Scripts:

- `yarn start` - Runs development server with CSS sourcemaps and drafts enabled, as well as the image task with watch.
- `yarn build:preview` - Runs the server with `production` for the environment with asset minification and postCSS enabled, and optimized images
- `yarn build` - The same as `build:preview` but builds production ready site in `public` directory with minified/optimized assets
- `yarn build:images` - Runs gulp images task to optimize images in `./static/img/`
- `yarn deploy` - uses (Flightdeck Liftoff)[https://github.com/flight-deck/Flightdeck-Liftoff] for deployments, see [Liftoff for usage](https://github.com/flight-deck/Flightdeck-Liftoff#readme)
  - Please note: Hugo's built in deployment options currently does not support DigitalOcean
- `yarn clean:node` - removes only Node dependencies
- `yarn clean:site` - removes the `public/` directory
- `yarn purge` - removes everything and does a fresh install using Yarn.
